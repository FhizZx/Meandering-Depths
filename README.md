# Meandering-Depths

A small project of mine, using Scala with LWJGL to create a 3D game of some kind. The main idea is having a character that explores an extensive cave system (might even be infinite in all directions). The terrain would be voxel based, the mesh being generated with marching cubes. Not sure how the gameplay will work, some ideas would be trying to be as sneaky as possible, so as to not get noticed by hostile creatures, and perhaps one goal of the game would be to escape the caves somehow, or maybe it will be story based who knows really.
